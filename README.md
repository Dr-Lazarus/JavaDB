SimpleDB
====
A simple database built from scratch that has some of the basic RDBMS features like a SQL query parser, transactions, and a query optimizer. This database was inspired from MIT's database systems course which has all their students implement a basic database from scratch. After completing the course, I have made some tweaks and added my own features.
